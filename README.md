The entertainment business is inherently an industry with quite a bit of risk. Each individual movie has budgets, essentially investments, that can exceed hundreds of millions of dollars. It is not a guarantee whether these investments will pay off. It would be beneficial for studios to be able to predict how much a movie will make in gross receipts based upon a variety of combination of obvious and non-obvious factors. They can then make better decisions on which projects to greenlight, and even perhaps limit (or scale up) the appropriate budget.

This model is intended to assist movie studios in making decisions on whether or not to move ahead with a certain movie. This is usually years before the movie even comes out. Other models might use additional data based upon data that can be gathered leading up to a movieâ€™s release (trailer views, social media data, etc.) but that information would not be available to a studio who is making their decision before any of this happens.
